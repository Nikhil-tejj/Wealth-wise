To maintain a healthy financial balance, we recommend allocating 70% of income ($420) towards essential expenses, saving 10% ($60) for emergency funds and leisure activities, and investing 20% ($120) in assets. We also suggest reviewing and optimizing the user's expenses to reduce unnecessary costs and allocate more funds towards savings and investments.\n",

This will enable the user to potentially optimize their returns and meet their long-term investment goals. Specifically, we suggest allocating the $300 investment amount towards a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes, with a target allocation ratio of 60-70% stock and 30-40% bonds.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Additional Recommendations:** Based on the user's current savings rate ($400) and investment amount ($300), we recommend exploring opportunities to increase their savings rate to 10-15% of income ($60-$90) by allocating more funds towards their emergency fund and long-term investments. This will enable the user to build a healthier financial cushion and achieve their long-term investment goals more efficiently.\n",

The remaining 10% ($1,000) should be directed towards savings and debt repayment. For the investment amount of $900, we suggest allocating 10% to a high-risk, high-return investment portfolio and 90% to a moderate-risk, moderate-return investment portfolio.\n",
            "2. **Risk Level:** Considering the user's risk tolerance is middle, we recommend a balanced investment portfolio with a moderate level of risk (4-6 on the risk scale). This will provide a balance between returns and risk, allowing the user to grow their investments while minimizing potential losses.\n",
            "3. **Investment Strategy:** For the high-risk, high-return investment portfolio (10%), we suggest allocating $90 to a small-cap stock index fund or an international stock fund. For the moderate-risk, moderate-return investment portfolio (90%), we recommend allocating $810 to a balanced index fund or a bond fund. This strategy will help the user achieve long-term financial goals while managing risk.\n",
