## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced financial world, individuals struggle with complex financial planning and investment decisions. Traditional finance apps offer either basic rule-based insights or rely on slow GPU-based AI models, resulting in delayed advice and missed opportunities. Users need real-time, personalized financial guidance that adapts to their unique goals and risk profiles.

Wealth Wise addresses this by leveraging Groq's LPU technology to deliver instant, intelligent financial advisory. With blazing-fast inference speeds (300+ tokens/second) and integrated mathematical analysis, we provide real-time, data-backed financial recommendations that transform how users manage their wealth.

## 🎯 Objective

WealthWise is a AI-powered financial advisory and education platform that provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface for investment planning and financial analysis. It offers an interactive AI chatbot, real-time market simulation, personalized insights, and comprehensive financial education resources, making financial literacy accessible to users of all levels.
